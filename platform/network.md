# Network Concepts Guide

This guide covers fundamental networking concepts, focusing on IP addresses, subnets, CIDR notation, and related commands for network management.

## IP Address

An **IP Address** (Internet Protocol Address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It enables communication between devices on local and wide-area networks (WANs), including the internet.

### Structure of an IP Address

- An IP Address is typically written as four groups of numbers separated by periods (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
- Each group represents an **8-bit** number (ranging from 0 to 255), equivalent to 1 byte.
- In total, an IP address contains 32 bits or 4 bytes.

## Subnet and CIDR Notation

### What is a Subnet?

A **Subnet** (short for Subnetwork) divides a large network into smaller, manageable segments. Subnets help optimize network performance, security, and IP address allocation.

- Subnets are created within a larger network, often called a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in cloud computing environments.
- Each subnet has its own range of IP addresses and typically connects to other subnets and the internet through a **Router**.

### CIDR Notation

**CIDR** (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a notation used to specify IP address ranges and the subnet mask for a network. CIDR notation is commonly written as an IP address, followed by a slash (`/`) and a number that indicates the number of bits in the **network prefix**.

Example: `192.168.0.0/21`

- **192.168.0.0**: The starting IP address of the range.
- **/21**: Indicates that the first 21 bits of the address are fixed for the subnet (network prefix), while the remaining bits can vary to allow multiple unique addresses within the range.

### Subnet Mask

A **Subnet Mask** defines which part of the IP address refers to the network and which part refers to individual devices (hosts) on that network. In CIDR notation, `/21` translates to a subnet mask of `255.255.248.0`, which allows for a network range supporting multiple IP addresses.

- **Subnet Mask Calculation**: The number in the CIDR notation determines how many bits are 1s in the subnet mask. For instance, `/24` corresponds to `255.255.255.0`.
- **IP Range**: The larger the CIDR number, the smaller the range of IPs within that subnet. Conversely, a smaller CIDR number (like `/16`) provides a larger IP address range.

## Public vs. Private IP Addresses

### Public IP

A **Public IP Address** is a globally unique IP address assigned to a device for direct communication over the internet. Public IPs are typically assigned by an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

**Example Command: Find Your Public IP Address**
```bash
curl ipecho.net/plain ; echo
```

### Private IP

A **Private IP Address** is used within private networks, such as home or corporate LANs (Local Area Networks). Private IP addresses are not routable on the internet and are reserved for internal network use. Common ranges for private IPs include:
- `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`
- `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`
- `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`

## IP Address Classes

IP addresses are divided into classes that determine the range and purpose of each IP:

- **Class A**: `1.0.0.0` to `126.0.0.0` - For large networks with many devices.
- **Class B**: `128.0.0.0` to `191.255.0.0` - For medium-sized networks.
- **Class C**: `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.0` - For smaller networks.
- **Class D**: `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255` - Reserved for multicast groups.
- **Class E**: `240.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255` - Reserved for experimental and future use.

## NAT and DHCP

### NAT (Network Address Translation)

**NAT** allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address for accessing the internet. NAT modifies IP addresses in packet headers as they pass through a router or firewall.

### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

**DHCP** is a protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network. Instead of manually configuring each device with an IP address, DHCP servers dynamically assign and manage IPs for devices as they connect.

## Key Network Commands

1. **Display Network Interface Information**
   ```bash
   ifconfig
   ```

2. **Check IP Routes**
   ```bash
   ip route show
   ```

3. **Ping a Network**
   ```bash
   ping [IP or hostname]
   ```

4. **Trace Network Path**
   ```bash
   traceroute [IP or hostname]
   ```
